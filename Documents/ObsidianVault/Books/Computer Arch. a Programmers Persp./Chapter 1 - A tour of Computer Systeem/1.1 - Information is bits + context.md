`hello.c`
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, World\n");

    return 0;
}
```
- Our `hello.c` program begins life as a _source program (or source file)_ that the programmer creates with an editor and saves in a text file called `hello.c`
- The source program is a sequence of _bits_, each with a value of _0_ or _1_, organized in 8-bit chunks called _bytes_.
 - Each byte represents some text character in the program.
 - Most computer systems represent text characters using the _ASCII standard_ that represents each character with a unique byte-size integer value.
 - The hello.c program is stored in a file as a sequence of bytes. Each byte corresponds to the respective character in the program starting from the beginning.
 - Each byte has a corresponding integer representation.e.g
 > \- The first byte has the integer value 35, which corresponds to the character ‘#’.
 > \- The second byte has the integer value 105, which corresponds to the character ‘i’, and so on.
- Files that exclusively consist of ASCII characters are known as _text files_.
- All other files are known as _binary files_.
