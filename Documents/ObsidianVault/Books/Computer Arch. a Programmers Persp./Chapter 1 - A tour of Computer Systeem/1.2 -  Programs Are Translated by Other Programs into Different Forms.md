- The hello program is a high level c program since it can be read and understood by humans.
- In order to run hello.c on the system, the individual C statements must be translated by other programs into a sequence of _low-level machine-language instructions_. 
- These instructions are then packaged in a form called an _executable object program_ and stored as a _binary disk file_:
#### Basic representation of source file to object file translation:
 ![[CAAPP - 1.2(1)|500]]
> Object programs are also known as _executable object files_.
> Translation is also known as _compilation_.

-  On a Unix system, the translation from source file to object file is performed by a _compiler driver_:

### Compilation process of the `hello.c` file :

![[CAAPP - 1.2(2)|9000]]
- Here, the gcc compiler driver reads the source file _hello.c_ and translates it into an executable object file _hello_.
- The compilation phase consists of 4 stages :

_1. Pre-processing Phase (pre-processor)_:
- The preprocessor (cpp) modifies the original C program according to directives that begin with the ‘#’ character.
- For example, the _#include<stdio.h>_ command in line 1 of hello.c tells the preprocessor to read the contents of the system header file stdio.h and insert it directly into the program text.
- The resulting program has the _.i_ extension.

 _2. The compilation phase_ :
- The compiler (cc1) translates the text file hello.i into the text file hello.s, which contains an assembly-language program.
 - Assembly language is useful because it provides a common output language for different compilers for different high-level languages.

 _3. Assembly Phase_ :
 -  the assembler (as) translates hello.s into machine language instructions, packages them in a form known as a relocatable object program, and stores the result in the object file hello.o.
 -  If we were to view hello.o with a text editor, it would appear to be gibberish.
 
 _4. Linking Phase_ :
 -  our hello program calls the printf function, whichis part of the standard C library provided by every C compiler.
 - The printf function resides in a separate precompiled object file called printf.o, which must somehow be merged with our hello.o program. The linker handles this merging.
 - The result is the hello file, which is an executable object file (or simply executable) that is ready to be loaded into memory and executed by the system.
