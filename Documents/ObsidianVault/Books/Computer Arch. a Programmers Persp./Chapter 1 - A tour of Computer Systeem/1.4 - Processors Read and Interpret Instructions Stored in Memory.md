- the `hello.c` program has been translated by compilation system to an executable object file called `hello` that is stored the disk.
- to run the file, the name of the executable is typed on the _shell_.
- A shell is a command-line interprator application program that executes user provided commands.
- If the first word of the command line does not correspond to a built-in shell command, then the shell assumes that it is the name of an executable file that it should load and run.
