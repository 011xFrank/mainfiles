- Data structures in C are normally fixed in size. e.g The number of elements in an array is fixed once the program is compiled.
- This is a problem since we are forced to choose their sizes before compilation. Hence The need for _dynamic storage allocation_ (The ability to allocate memory during program execution).
- Through dynamic memory allocation, we can create programms that allocate/de-allocate memory storage to data structures that grow and shrink as needed.
- Dynamic Memory Allocation is mostly used with : _arrays_, _strings_ and _structures_.

_Memory Allocation Functions_ :
1. [[malloc()]] - Allocates a block of memory but does not initialize it.
2. [[calloc()]] - Allocates a block of memory and clears it.
3. realloc - Resizes a previously allocated block of memory.
