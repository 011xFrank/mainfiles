- Syntax : `declaration-specifiers declarators;`
- `declaration-specifiers` provide the properties of the variable being declared.
- `declarators` provide the name.

## Declaration Specifiers
1. Storage Classes
2. Type Qualifiers
3. Type Specifiers

### 1. Storage Classes
**auto**
- The auto storage class is legal only for variables that belong to a block.
- An auto variable has _automatic storage duration_ (not surprisingly), _block scope_, and _no linkage_.
-  auto is the default for variables declared inside a block.

**static**
- When used outside a block, the word static specifies that a variable has internal linkage.(_static essentially hides a variable within the file in which it’s declared; only functions that appear in the same file can see the variable._)
- When used inside a block, static changes the variable’s storage duration from automatic to static.
- A static variable declared within a block resides at the same storage location throughout program execution.(_a static variable will retain its value indefinitely._)

**extern**
- The extern storage class enables several source files to share the same variable.
- A variable in an extern declaration always has static storage duration.
